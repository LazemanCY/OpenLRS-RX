# OpenLRS-RX
My hardware design for 433MHz OpenLRS receiver.<br />
It's a clone of HobbyKing OpenLRS_RX but it could use 5V FTDI directly without harming RF module. <br />
OpenLRS project details please refer to http://openlrsng.org/ <br />
Work files are under Altium Designer 15.1. <br />
It works with 100mW RFM22 module.<br />

And this is my Micro-OpenLRS module.<br />
It only provide PPM and RSSI output to make it simple.<br />
